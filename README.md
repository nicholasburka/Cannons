Game Manual - game1

The name of the game is Cannons. (It is based on the "Gunnery" game from the Puzzle Pirates MMORPG).

Cannons is a game in which the player's goal is to fill four cannons, located near the four corners of the board. Cannons must be filled with, in order, a bag of gunpowder, then cloth, then a cannonball. These components, along with miscellaneous junk parts, are strewn, slowly moving, around the deck. When components collide with a surface head on, they "turn" clockwise to the next moveable movable direction from up, down, left, and right.

The player can control parts by selecting one of four directions with the arrow keys and then clicking on the grid spot they want to place the arrow. Whenever a part hits an arrow, its direction becomes that of the arrow until it hits another arrow, the entrance to a cannon, or collides.

If a player incorrectly fills a cannon, they can wash it out with a bucket of water (another of the parts on the deck) to make the cannon empty.
