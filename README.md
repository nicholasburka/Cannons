Game Manual - game1

The name of the game is Cannon. (It is [almost] based on the "Gunnery" game from the Puzzle Pirates MMORPG).

Cannons is a game in which the player's goal is to fill the cannon with stuff! Just don't let the water in. Stuff can get into the cannon's entrance from any direction. The more stuff you let in, the bigger the score. And do it quick! Otherwise your score will decrease.

Control the stuff by making arrows. You can have up to five arrows, which you produce by clicking where you want 'em. Hectic fun! Control the type of arrow by pushing the arrow keys or WASD before clicking. If you want to erase an arrow, hit x and then click.

Hit q to end the game.

Whenever stuff gets in the cannon, another random stuff appears at a valid location on the screen!
